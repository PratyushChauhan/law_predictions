The current document is an appeal by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) against a judgment by the Delhi High Court that classified FICCI as a "commercial establishment" under the Delhi Shops and Establishments Act, 1954. FICCI's counsel argues that this classification was made based on a misapprehension of facts and requires reconsideration, as FICCI is a Federation of Federations and not an association of individual traders, industrialists, or businessmen. FICCI's counsel raises a preliminary objection that the current appeal should not be allowed, as the argument that FICCI's activity amounts to a business or trade was not made before the High Court. FICCI's counsel further argues that the primary activity of FICCI is one of general utility, with occasional exhibitions and museums being incidental or ancillary to its charitable object. The only source of FICCI's income is from subscriptions, and no profits are shared or divided among individual members, and no goods are sold or exchanged. FICCI's counsel also doubts the correctness of the decision in a previous case, as it holds that FICCI's activity partakes the character of trade or business. However, the document discusses a related case, K. Mittal, where the definition of "industry" in the Income Tax Act was wider than that of "commercial establishment" in the Wealth Tax Act. The document argues that the decision in K. Mittal's case was correctly decided and does not require reconsideration. The case at hand, involving the Federation, is similar as it carries out systematic activities to assist its members and other businessmen and industrialists, including setting up tribunals, taking up specific difficulties, and securing expert technical help. These activities are considered business activities and the Federation's pre premises are classified as a "commercial establishment" under the Wealth Tax Act. The document concludes with the appeal being allowed and the High Court's judgment being set aside. No costs were ordered in this case.
