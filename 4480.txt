In the second case, the employees union applied to correct an error in the award, claiming that the Tribunal had intended to grant a flat increase of Rs. 150/ to each draughtsman and Rs. 100/ to all other workmen, but this was not clearly mentioned in the award due to an accidental slip or omission. The employer did not oppose the correction sought by the union, and the Tribunal corrected the award by adding the necessary words to clarify the position. The court dismissed the appeal related to this correction, as it found that the correction was within the bounds of the authority of the Tribunal.
