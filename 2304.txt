The current document is an appeal against a judgment and decree in a Second Appeal related to the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act, 1949, as amended up to 1953. The case involves a dispute between a landlord and tenant over the protection of the Act for thika tenants. The landlord attempted to evict the tenant before the enactment of the Act, but the tenant claimed protection under its provisions. The court determined that the landlord had not established the necessary grounds for eviction, and the appeal was dismissed. The court also noted that the legislature did not intend to impose a ban on all pre-Act suits, as evidenced by the omission of certain sections in the Act. The document provides a historical overview of the Act and its amendments, highlighting the limitations of its narrow definition of a thika tenant and the need for amendments to provide adequate protection. The court reserved judgment on whether compliance with a specific section of the Act was required in this case, as it was unclear whether that section was prospective or not. The document concludes by summarizing the current state of the Act and its applicability to pending cases.
