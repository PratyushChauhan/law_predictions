The current legal case involves an appeal brought to the Supreme Court by special leave, arising from a dispute over agricultural lands in Eragudi village, Musiri taluk, Tiruchirappalli district. The appellants claimed that the lands had been granted in Inam to the ancestor of one Ambalathadum Pachai Kandai Udayavar by the Carnatic Rulers before the British power in India, and that the properties were alienated from time to time, with the appellants becoming entitled to them. The respondents claimed that the properties belonged to the Pachai Kandai Udayavar Temple and formed part of its properties. The trial court found in favor of the appellants, but the lower appellate court and the Madras High Court partially reversed the decision, holding that the original grant had been made in favor of the Temple and that the appellants' title in regard to certain alienations was open to challenge due to the application of Article 134 B of the Indian Limitation Act. The appellants argued that the application of Article 134 B was not applicable because the alienors purported to transfer the properties not as Poojaris or managers of the temple, but in their individual character as owners of the said properties. The appellants also argued that in applying Article 144, the possession of the alienees should be assumed to be adverse to the temple from the respective dates of the alienations when they were put in possession of the properties covered by the transactions in question. The appellants' claim in regard to the other properties was upheld. The case raises questions about the applicability of article 134 B of the Limitation Act, which deals with transfers by previous managers of religious endowments. The High Court had previously decided that the article did not apply to an execution sale, but the current case involves transfers made by the previous managers. The lower courts had found that the previous managers were still alive and had not been removed, but the current appeal argues that the evidence shows that they had been removed and replaced by de facto managers. The case ultimately results in the appeal being allowed, and the lower court's decision is restored. The parties are directed to bear their own costs.
