The current legal case involves an appeal by a postal officer who was convicted for secretly possessing five registered letters in violation of the Indian Post Office Act and the Indian Penal Code. The officer argued that the letters were planted by his opponent faction during a search at his house and were not properly listed during the search. The High Court found the officer guilty, but the evidence only showed that the letters were found in a locked almirah shared by the officer and his father. The High Court allowed the officer's appeals, as the prosecution failed to prove that the letters were in the officer's exclusive possession. The Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision, stating that the officer's possession of the letters for an inordinate length of time, despite acknowledgments of delivery from the addressees, was sufficient evidence of secreting. The Supreme Court also rejected the officer's arguments that the letters were no longer in the course of transmission by post due to the delay in delivery and the existence of acknowledgments, and that entrustment was necessary for certain offenses under the Indian Post Office Act. The officer's sentence, which consisted of three consecutive sentences, was deemed not excessively severe. The Supreme Court also clarified that the legislature had enlarged the scope of the provision to include secretion, destruction, or throwing away of postal articles by an officer of the post office, regardless of entrustment.
