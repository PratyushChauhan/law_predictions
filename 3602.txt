The current document is related to two appeals against a judgment and order from the Punjab and Haryana High Court in 1975. The appellants, who are members of the Bar Association, wrote letters to the President and other officials, expressing their concerns about the behavior of Justice D.S. Tewatia during his visit to their district. They alleged that the judge criticized the government's policies and attacked its decisions, both political and administrative. The High Court issued a notice for criminal contempt, but did not take action against two of the appellants. Each appellant submitted an affidavit, stating that their letter was intended to maintain the dignity and respect of the courts and judges, and that it did not interfere with the proper administration of justice. The Full Bench of the High Court accepted the apology tendered by the appellants, but the Supreme Court has set aside this decision, as there was no finding of contempt. The Court has clarified that judges should not get involved in political matters or policies, and should not accept invitations or hospitality from political parties or organizations with sectarian, communal, or parochial affiliations. The Court has dropped the contempt proceedings, as it did not find any contempt in the appellants' letter.
