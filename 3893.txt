The current document is an appeal by Special Leave to the Supreme Court in a civil case in India regarding the inheritance of a joint family property after the death of the male head of the family. The plaintiff, the widow of the deceased, has claimed a 7/24th share in the property based on the provisions of the Hindu Succession Act. The defendant, the deceased's son, has contested the claim, arguing that the property was not part of the joint family and that his father had already partitioned it between himself and his sons. The trial court and the Bombay High Court have both ruled in favor of the plaintiff, but the defendant has appealed to the Supreme Court. The case hinges on the interpretation of Explanation 1 of section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act, which creates a fiction that a partition of the property took place immediately before the death of the deceased, in order to determine the share of the deceased in the joint family property and the share of the plaintiff in that share. The document emphasizes the importance of treating this assumption as a concrete reality and working out all its consequences, as ignoring it for calculating the quantum of the share of the heirs would permit one's imagination to boggle. The document also mentions that the interpretation which further the legislative intent in regard to the enlargement of the share of female heirs, qualitatively and quantitatively, should be preferred. The document cites several court cases, including Rangubai Lalji vs Laxman Lalji and Sushilabai Ramachandra Kulkarni vs Narayanrao Gopalrao Deshpande & Ors., which have taken the same view. The document concludes by confirming the judgment of the High Court and dismissing the appeal with costs.
