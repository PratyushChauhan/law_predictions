The current document is an appeal by the plaintiff against a decision by the High Court that his lawsuit had abated due to the death of the defendant during the appeal process. The lawsuit concerned the ownership and management of a religious institution, the Shiromani Nirankari Dera, with the plaintiff claiming to be the lawfully appointed mahant and the defendant claiming to be the rightful mahant. The High Court found that the appeal had abated as the plaintiff failed to bring forward the legal representatives of the defendant within the prescribed time, but the plaintiff argued that the interest in the subject matter of the lawsuit had devolved upon the defendant's successor, Shiam Dass, upon his election as mahant. The court ultimately agreed with the plaintiff's argument and reversed the decision of the High Court, directing it to dispose of the appeal on merits.
