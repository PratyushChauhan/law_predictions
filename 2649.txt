The current document is a court judgment from the High Court of Gujarat regarding an appeal by special leave from a decision made by the Court of Small Causes. The case involves a dispute over the legal nature of an agreement between two parties, with the plaintiff (Filmistan) arguing that it is a lease and the defendants making a different claim. The trial court did not make a decision on this issue. In a separate case, the High Court found that the agreement created a lease. However, the High Court's decision to record a finding on the issue of res judicata in the context of the current appeal was deemed as beyond its jurisdiction, as it was not a decision made by the trial court. The High Court did not make a final decision on the legal nature of the agreement, but found that the consent decree created a bar of res judicata regarding the question of whether the document in question created a lease. The trial court should proceed with the case and dispose of it expeditiously, and Filmistan is required to pay the costs of the appeal in both the High Court and the current court. The form of certain issues will be rectified by the trial court. Overall, the document highlights the importance of following the correct legal procedures and the limitations of the High Court's jurisdiction in certain cases.
