The current document is an appeal by the state of Maharashtra against a judgment in favor of Bhaishankar Avalram Joshi, a former government servant. Joshi had filed a lawsuit seeking a declaration that his dismissal order from 1955 was unlawful due to a breach of Article 311(2) of the Constitution, which requires reasonable opportunity to be provided to the government servant. The High Court of Gujarat ordered a variation in the decree, stating that Joshi continued to be in government service until the date of the suit and awarded him arrears of pay until that date. The state of Maharashtra filed a cross-objection, claiming that the suit should be dismissed. The appeal raises two main points: first, whether the High Court erred in finding a breach of Article 311(2), as the state of Maharashtra contends that no duty to supply a copy of the report of the enquiry was required; and second, whether the High Court erred in fastening liability for the arrears of pay on the state of Maharashtra. The document also discusses the Bombay Reorganisation Act, 1960, which deals with the apportionment of assets and liabilities between the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat, and the liability to pay arrears of pay, which is based on a contract and arises out of the relationship between the government and its public servants. The document cites several legal cases, including Owner or section section Raphael v, Brandy, and Inland Revenue Commissioners vs Hambrook, to support the arguments presented. The document also touches on the legal status of civil servants and whether they have contractual rights. The judgments cited in the document suggest that while civil servants are not considered to have a contract with the Crown, they may have contractual rights before their termination. The document concludes with a decision in a legal case where the decree for arrears of salary is classified as a liability in proceedings relating to a contract, rather than a tort. The case is dismissed with costs to the respondent.
