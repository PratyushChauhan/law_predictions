The current document is an appeal by workers against an award made by an Industrial Tribunal in a labor dispute with their employer, Orient Paper Mills Ltd. The dispute concerned minimum wages and bonuses. The Tribunal found that there were no comparable industries in the region to the company, but identified other industries in the region where minimum wages were higher than those paid by the company. However, the Tribunal only worked out minimum wages based on a different approach instead of fixing them based on the identified industries. The workers argued that the Tribunal committed errors in this calculation, and the company argued that the principle of fixing wages based on comparison in the region was not rigid and that lower wages in other comparable industries in the area should also be taken into account. The court rejected this argument, as the identified industries were very small and not comparable with the company. The court also rejected the argument that wages in other parts of the country should be taken into account, as this was not relevant when applying the principle of fixing minimum wages based on comparison between different industries in the same region. The court found that the company should have fixed minimum wages based on the average level of wages in the identified comparable industries in the region, and the alternative calculation made by the Tribunal should not have been used to arrive at a lower figure. The workers also demanded that casual workers be paid minimum wages on the same basis as permanent workers, but the Tribunal rejected this due to the nature of casual employment. The company argued that the increase in wages would result in heavy arrears, but the court upheld the decision to increase wages from December 13, 1962. The workers also challenged the decision regarding bonus for the year 1962-63, arguing that the Tribunal should have used the Full Bench Formula approved by the court in a previous case. However, the court found that the demand for bonus was not based on this formula and that the dispute was raised before the end of the year, when completed accounts were not available. Therefore, the court upheld the decision regarding bonus. The appeal was partly allowed, with the minimum wage fixed by the tribunal being carried, and the company was ordered to pay the workers' costs in the appeal. The rest of the tribunal's award was upheld.
