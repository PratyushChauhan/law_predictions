The current document is an appeal by a defendant who was acquitted by the trial court for the murder of his wife but was later convicted by the high court. The defendant argued that his version of events was more probable than that of the prosecution witnesses, but the high court found that the discrepancies in their testimonies were minor and that the medical evidence supported the prosecution's version. The defendant also claimed that the knife used in the crime was not properly seized or analyzed, but the court found that this did not affect the outcome of the case. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence of the defendant, stating that appellate courts can review the entire evidence and come to their own conclusions, while bearing in mind certain considerations. The court also noted that the defendant was entitled to the benefit of doubt only where two views of the evidence were possible, and that the trial court's decision to take a possible view and acquit the defendant did not require the high court to interfere with the order of acquittal. The court emphasized that the principle that the accused is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt is not new and stems from the fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence. The court also stated that fanciful and remote possibilities must be left out of account, and if the preponderance of probability is all one way, a bare possibility of another view will not entitle the accused to claim the benefit of any doubt. The court concluded by stating that if the trial court allows itself to be beset with fanciful doubts, rejects creditworthy evidence for slender reasons, and takes a view of the evidence that is but barely possible, the appellate court has an obligation to interfere in the interest of justice, lest the administration of justice be brought to ridicule. The appeal in the current case was dismissed.
