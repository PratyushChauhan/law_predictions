The current document is an appeal by special leave in an industrial matter before the Supreme Court of India. The appellant, a saw mill, terminated the services of an employee named Sankaran under Rule 18(a) of its Standing Orders, which allows for the dismissal of an employee without holding a departmental inquiry. The Industrial Tribunal later set aside the order of dismissal, finding that the appellant had intended to take disciplinary action against Sankaran but subsequently dropped it and acted under Rule 18(a) as a colourable exercise of power. The Supreme Court upheld the decision of the Industrial Tribunal, stating that the requirement of bona fides is essential in such cases and that the employer must defend the action taken under Rule 18(a) by leading evidence before the tribunal to show that there was in fact misconduct. The Court also noted that the employer cannot rest its case merely on the contract and say that it has unfettered right "to hire and fire" its employees, as this right is now subject to industrial adjudication. The Court emphasized that the Industrial Tribunal has the right to inquire into the causes that led to the termination of service, even under a rule like Rule 18(a), and if it is satisfied that the action taken was not bona fide or was a result of victimisation or unfair labour practice, it has jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination. The Court dismissed the appeal with costs.
