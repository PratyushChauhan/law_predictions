The current document involves two legal cases related to wage revisions for employees. In the first case, Tata Consulting Engineers (TCE) challenged an award by the Industrial Tribunal that revised wage scales and granted flat increases to certain categories of employees. The TCE argued that the decision to make the wage scales retrospective and range the retrospectivity back to 1976 was unwarranted and fell beyond the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The workmen also appealed against the rejection of their claim for a cost-of-living-indexed dearness allowance. The court found that the cost of living had increased significantly since 1972, and the dearness and house rent allowances made little impact in neutralising the increasing cost. The court upheld the award, finding that there was ample justification for the retrospectivity and the flat increases granted to employees in certain categories.
