The current document is a judgment from the Indian Supreme Court in the case of Civil Appeal No. 1744 of 1968. The case involves a writ petition challenging the final integration list prepared by the Mysore State government under Section 115 of the Indian Forest Act. The petitioner, Dr. R.D. Nanjiah, claimed that he was not given a fair opportunity to object to his position in the final list, relying on a decision of the Supreme Court in Union of India vs G.M. Shankariah & Ors. However, the Supreme Court found that the decision in Shankariah's case was limited to a provisional list and did not apply to a final list. The Court also noted that the principle of natural justice does not require an unlimited number of opportunities to be heard, and that the preparation of a final seniority list is not comparable to the punishment stage of a departmental trial. The Court found that the Central Government had acted properly in accordance with the provisions of the Act, and that the petitioner had been unable to make out any grounds for interference with the final list. The Court allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment of the Mysore High Court. The parties were ordered to bear their own costs.
