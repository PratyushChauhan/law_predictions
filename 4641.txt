The current document is an appeal against a judgment and decree of the Allahabad High Court in a civil suit regarding the ownership of certain properties. The properties in question were purchased by Mahant Shivshanker Yati, a member of the Dashnami Sanyasi sect, using funds inherited from his predecessor. The plaintiffs claimed that the properties belonged to the Math Sauna or the deity Sri Thakur Gokarneshwar Mahadeoji and that Mahant Sadashiva Yati, who succeeded Mahant Shivshanker Yati, was entitled to possession as Mahant and Sarbarakar. However, the High Court found that the funds used to purchase the properties were the personal property of Mahant Shivshanker Yati, and on his death, they passed to his successor, Uma Shanker Yati. The appeal was dismissed, and it was determined that the properties did not belong to the Math Sauna or the deity, but rather constituted the personal property of Uma Shanker Yati. The High Court also found that the properties had been described as belonging to the Math in assessment proceedings, but this was done solely for the purpose of avoiding personal liability to tax.
