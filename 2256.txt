The current court case involves a dispute between K.K. Tea Company and a village panchayat in Maharashtra regarding the legality of the panchayat's levy of octroi duty. The panchayat, originally established under the C.P. & Berar Panchayat Act, became deemed as a panchayat under the Bombay Village Panchayat Act in 1961. In 1963, the panchayat passed a resolution to levy octroi duty on goods entering its limits, which was challenged by the Company before the Panchayat Samiti. The Panchayat Samiti rejected the Company's appeal as being time-barred, but the Company appealed to the Standing Committee, Zila Parishad, Nagpur, which allowed the appeal on the grounds that the panchayat needed to obtain approval from the Collector for fixing octroi limits and that the Company was not importing tea within the limits of the panchayat for consumption, use, or sale. The High Court later upheld the decision of the Standing Committee, but did not address the second ground as sufficient facts had not been found by the Standing Committee. The Company then appealed to the Supreme Court, which affirmed the High Court's decision and declared that the panchayat could validly impose octroi duty from January 14, 1964, in accordance with the resolutions passed by the panchayat. The Supreme Court clarified that the fixing of the commencement of the period of limitation for all appeals under section 124(5) of the Panchayat Act was not arbitrary or destructive of the right of appeal, as the rule in question, r.5, applied only to appeals against the levy of any tax or fee. The case was remanded to the High Court to determine whether the Company imported tea for consumption, use, or sale within the octroi limits of the panchayat, and no costs were awarded in the appeal.
