The current document is a court judgment related to two civil appeals in the Supreme Court of India. The case involves a dispute over the ownership and operation of a cinema theater in Jammu and Kashmir called Apsara Theatre. The theater was initially operated by Ved Gupta, who obtained a license from the government to show cinematographic films. Gupta later formed a partnership with two other individuals, and the theater was transferred to the partnership. The partnership deed stated that the theater was the property of the partnership, and the license granted to Gupta was treated as the property of the partnership. After two partners retired from the partnership, a new partnership deed was executed, and it was agreed that the license would remain with the partnership. Later, one of the former partners, Todar Mal, claimed that the license should also be transferred to him and his former partner, Krishan Kumar. The district magistrate rejected this claim, and the decision was upheld by the state government and the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir. However, Krishan Kumar continued to dispute the matter, and the case eventually reached the Supreme Court. The current judgment in the Supreme Court allows the appeal by setting aside the orders of the High Court and the district magistrate, and restores the order of the single judge. The judgment also notes that the theater had been suspended by the district magistrate due to unauthorized operation by others, and the suspension will remain in effect until further orders. The judgment does not address any other issues related to the ownership or operation of the theater beyond this dispute over the license.
