The current document is an appeal by the Income Tax Officer against the decision of the Allahabad High Court regarding the taxability of a pension-like allowance received by the assessee's predecessor in 1837. The allowance was granted as a result of a settlement with the British Government, following a dispute over land. The settlement involved the assessee's predecessor relinquishing his title to the land in exchange for a pension of varying amounts, calculated as one-fourth of the net land revenue collections. The Income Tax Officer argued that this income was taxable as it arose from a statutory obligation of the Government and was not agricultural income. However, the Allahabad High Court found that the immediate source of the income was not land, but rather the settlement agreement, and therefore it was not agricultural income. The appellant argued that the pension varied from year to year, suggesting that it was a capital receipt, but the court rejected this argument, stating that the quality of the income should be considered, rather than its periodicity. The court ultimately upheld the decision of the High Court, finding that the pension was not taxable as agricultural income. The appellant's appeal is allowed, and they will be responsible for the costs incurred in both the High Court and the current appeal. The judgment discusses the distinction between capital receipts and income, the importance of determining the true character of a payment rather than relying on its label, and the rejection of the doctrine of substance over form in tax matters.
