The current legal case in the Supreme Court of India involves appeals by two bank employees, Ram Parkash and Tek Chand Sharma, challenging the fixation of their salaries under the Desai award, which replaced the Sastry award. The case concerns the interpretation of paragraph 5.356 of the Desai award, which involves determining the basic pay of workmen who entered service before January 1, 1959. The court clarified that adjustments to basic pay had to be made based on the actual basic pay as on January 1, 1959, and then increments had to be added based on certain conditions. The court also clarified that two additional increments provided in the Desai award had to be given after adjustments were made, regardless of whether the actual basic pay as on January 1, 1959, was less than the adjusted basic pay. The court allowed Ram Parkash's challenge and dismissed Tek Chand Sharma's challenge, and no costs were awarded in either case. The court referred to a similar case, Prakash Chand Mehra, in which it interpreted the relevant provisions of a previous award, the Sastry award as modified. The court concluded that the relevant clauses in the Desai award should be interpreted in the same manner as in the Prakash Chand Mehra case, and that the adjusted basic pay in clause (ii) should be taken as on January 1, 1959. The court clarified that the Desai award made certain changes due to the lapse of time, but these changes did not affect the substance of what was provided by the Sastry award as modified. The court partially accepted the workmen's contention that they were entitled to what was provided by sub clauses (a), (b), and (c) of clause (iv), as well as the two increments under sub clause (d), subject to the maximum provided under clause (ii). The bank contested this interpretation, but the court did not agree with its position.
