The current document is about a legal case where the appellants challenged the validity of an electoral roll due to omissions in the roll. They initially did not object to the deadline for submitting claims and objections until December 6, 1978, causing a delay in filing the petition. The High Court dismissed the petition due to the delay, and the appellants appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the delay was not significant. The Supreme Court agreed that the delay was inordinate but still needed to examine whether the High Court was right in dismissing the petition due to the delay. The Supreme Court ultimately found that the delay was significant and could lead to public inconvenience and interference with the rights of others, and dismissed the appeal. No costs were ordered.
