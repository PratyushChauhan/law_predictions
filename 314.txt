The current document is an appeal by the Union of India in the Supreme Court against a judgment of the Delhi High Court. The case involves the removal of Capt. section K. Rao from service due to allegations of gross misconduct. The Central Government ordered administrative action against Rao under Army Rule 14, which allows for removal from service without a court martial if further retention in service is deemed undesirable. Rao challenged this action in the High Court, arguing that Army Rule 14 was ultra vires the Army Act. The Supreme Court has now allowed the appeal, finding that Army Rule 14 is a valid rule and that Rao's case will be sent back to the High Court for further proceedings on other issues raised by Rao. No costs have been ordered.
