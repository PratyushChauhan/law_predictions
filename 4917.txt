In a separate legal dispute, Ved Gupta challenged the suspension of the cinema license at the Apsara Theatre by the District Magistrate due to unauthorized screenings by others. The High Court dismissed Gupta's writ petition, and he appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, but the Division Bench of the High Court allowed the District Magistrate's decision based on Rule 23 (3) of the High Court Rules. The Supreme Court has doubts about the correctness of this decision and has concluded that the District Magistrate had the authority to suspend the license, and there was no justification for the High Court's intervention. The Supreme Court has also clarified that the license was granted to Ved Gupta in his individual capacity and not to the partnership that owned the theater. Therefore, the firm and its partners are bound by this decision.
