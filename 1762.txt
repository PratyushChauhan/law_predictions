The current document discusses two legal cases related to tax exemptions granted to a mill in Jodhpur. In the first case, the Supreme Court determined that the agreement granting the exemptions was not a valid law. In the second case, the mill claimed that the exemptions were recognized by the new sovereign, but the Court found that a competent law passed by Parliament after the Constitution came into force overrode the exemptions. The Court also noted that in the second case, there was no competent law passed by the new state that negated the recognition of the exemptions, but the Court found that the mill could not derive any assistance from a previous case with different facts. The appeals in both cases were dismissed, and the Court ordered the respondent in one of the appeals to pay the costs of the appellant.
