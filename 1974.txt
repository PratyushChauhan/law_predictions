The current document is an appeal by the Shaw Wallace & Co. Against a decision made by the Maharashtra Industrial Tribunal regarding the retirement age of its employees. The dispute arose as the employees at the Bombay branch of the company claimed that they should not be retired before the age of 60, while the company had previously set the retirement age at 55, with the option to continue employment until 58 for those passing a medical examination at 55. The Industrial Tribunal ultimately directed that the retirement age should be 58, but the company could continue employment for those who wished to do so. The appeal argues that the retirement age should be fixed at 60, citing the prevailing practice in comparable concerns in the Bombay region and decisions made by the Pay Commission and the Norms Committee. The document also mentions that the company's employees at the Calcutta branch had previously agreed to extend their retirement age to 58. The appeal ultimately succeeds, and the retirement age for the company's employees is fixed at 60.
