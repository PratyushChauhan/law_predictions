The current document discusses the concept of final orders in various legal contexts, including under the Indian Constitution, Code of Civil Procedure, and Government of India Act. It explains that an order is final if it determines the rights of the parties in dispute in a suit or proceeding, and if the suit or proceeding is still pending and the rights in dispute have to be determined, the order is interlocutory. The document mentions previous legal cases and decisions that have established this principle, as well as a recent judgment that has been challenged but has not departed from the earlier principle. It clarifies that the finality of an order should not be judged by co relating it with the controversy in the complaint, but rather by whether the proceeding in question is self-contained and finally disposes of. The document also discusses legal cases related to criminal proceedings and the filing of complaints under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). It explains that the process of filing a complaint under section 476 of the CrPC is a self-contained proceeding that can result in the filing of a complaint under sections 205 and 114 of the IPC. Orders passed in appeals or revisions are not considered final if the suit or proceeding is still ongoing. The document highlights that different tests have been applied to orders made in independent proceedings, and an order that does not finally dispose of a suit or proceeding is not considered final for the purposes of the Constitution. It mentions a specific case, Mohanlal Maganlal ThakKar, which does not depart from earlier judgments regarding final orders. The document concludes with a summary of a legal case where the plaintiffs' suit may become infructuous due to an order of the High Court, but the order is still considered an interlocutory order and not final for the purposes of the Constitution.
