The current document is a petition challenging the constitutionality of the Public Employment (Requirement as to Residence) Act, 1957 and its implementing Rules in relation to the Telengana area. The petitioners, who are government employees in the Andhra Pradesh region, argue that the Act and Rules, which require a certain period of residence in the Telengana area prior to appointment, violate Article 16(3) of the Constitution, which allows Parliament to make laws prescribing residential qualifications for employment in a State or Union territory, but only in that State or Union territory. The court ultimately agrees with the petitioners, finding that the Act and Rules, as applied to the Telengana area, are ultra vires the Constitution, as the exception to the residential qualification requirement in the Constitution refers to a whole State or Union territory, and a narrow construction should be placed on this exception based on the debates in the Constituent Assembly. The court did not express an opinion on the validity of delegation to the Central and/or State Governments to provide rules for implementing the law made by Parliament, and the Mulki Rules existing in the former Hyderabad State were not addressed in this case. The petitions were allowed, but there was no order for costs.
