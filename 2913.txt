The current document is an appeal by 14 out of 20 accused in a dacoity case in India. They were convicted and sentenced to 5 years' rigorous imprisonment and a fine for their involvement in the crime. The High Court and lower court drew the presumption that they were dacoits based on the discovery of stolen goods in their possession, as there was no other evidence connecting them to the crime. The accused's lawyer argued that the presumption should have been one of complicity under a different section, as the circumstances did not warrant the drawing of the dacoit presumption. However, the court rejected this argument, stating that the presumption could be drawn when there was other evidence connecting the accused to the crime, and the discovery of stolen goods strengthened this evidence. The court reduced the sentence to 3 years' rigorous imprisonment, as the offense, while serious, did not result in significant injury beyond one. The appeal was partly allowed.
