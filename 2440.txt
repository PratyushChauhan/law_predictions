The current document is an appeal by special leave to the Supreme Court against the judgment of the Allahabad High Court finding five individuals guilty of contempt of court. The case involves a complaint filed in a Nyaya Panchayat, which was stayed by the High Court following an application and telegram from accused Mahabir. The Nyaya Panchayat proceeded with the case despite the stay order, and the accused filed an application in the High Court alleging disobedience of the order. The High Court found that the Nyaya Panchayat had disobeyed the order and committed contempt of court, as they did not believe the contents of Mahabir's application and affidavit and failed to verify whether he had filed them with the Sub Divisional Magistrate. The accused's counsel argued that no contempt of court had been established as the Nyaya Panchayats exercised judicial powers and could have erred in not staying proceedings. However, the Court held that the Nyaya Panchayats' action was not bona fide and amounted to wilful disobedience of the High Court's order. The accused were fined and sentenced to imprisonment for default. The Court also noted that those accused of contempt of court must be proven to have had knowledge of the order beyond all reasonable doubt, and if there is any doubt, the benefit should be given to the accused. In this case, the accused claimed they did not have knowledge of the order, but the only evidence presented was an application dated December 25, 1963, which did not contain the date of the order or a copy of the telegram. The High Court found fault with the fact that the reasons for not accepting the prayer for stay were not recorded, but the document argues that the High Court should be cautious in finding a judicial officer guilty of contempt of court for disobeying its orders unless there is clear evidence of knowledge. The document also notes that Panchas are not well-versed in law and procedure, and their records should not be judged in the same manner as that of ordinary courts. Ultimately, the document concludes that there is no clear evidence of knowledge in this case, and the appeal is allowed, with the judgment and order of the High Court set aside.
