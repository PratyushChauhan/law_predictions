The current document is a legal case related to two income tax appeals by a firm called Sait Nagjee Purushotham & Co. The firm had undergone several changes in its partnership structure, with new members joining and existing ones retiring or passing away. In 1937, a new partner named Hemchand was admitted, and in 1939, two deeds were executed that revoked earlier partnership agreements and established new ones. The firm carried out business in various areas, including piece goods, yarn, banking, and soap and umbrella manufacturing. The case revolves around the question of whether the firm's business had been discontinued in 1937 or 1939 and whether a succession to the business had taken place in 1948. The court ultimately ruled against the firm's appeal, determining that the business had been discontinued in 1937 or 1939 and that a succession to the business had not occurred in 1948. The case also involved discussions around the conditions required for relief under section 25(4) of the Income tax Act, including the requirement that the business had been charged to tax under the Indian Income tax Act, 1918, and that there had been a succession to the business after April 1, 1939. The case also touched on the issue of whether the transfer of the business to the limited company constituted a succession to the business under section 25(4). The court distinguished a previous decision that found a discontinuance in a family business, as the Income Tax Act thinks in terms of businesses rather than joint family businesses. The court also noted that while common partners could constitute two entirely separate firms for the purposes of the Indian Income tax Act, this was a question of fact and required a complete change of ownership for purposes of section 26(2). The court ultimately allowed the firm's appeals and found that the firm was entitled to the benefits of certain sections related to succession and discontinuance, but only in respect of the original business in piece goods, yarn, and banking.
