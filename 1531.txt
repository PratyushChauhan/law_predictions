The current legal case involves the interpretation of section 24B of the Income Tax Act in India regarding the assessment of income received by the heirs and legal representatives of a deceased solicitor, Amarchand N. Shroff. The Income Tax Officer sought to tax the realisations received by the heirs and legal representatives after Amarchand's death, but the High Court of Bombay answered the query in the negative. The Commissioner of Income tax appealed to the Appellate Tribunal, arguing that the amounts received by the heirs and legal representatives should be deemed as income received by Amarchand and liable to tax under section 24B. However, the Appellate Tribunal held that assessment could not be made on Amarchand and that section 24B had no application to the income received after his death. The case ultimately reached the Supreme Court, which also answered the query in the negative, stating that income tax is exigible in reference to a person's total income of the previous year and that the provisions of section 24B do not extend to tax liability of the estate of a deceased person beyond the previous or the account year in which that person dies. The Supreme Court clarified that the scheme of the Act, as given in previous cases, does not support the Commissioner of Income tax's contention. In neither of the previous cases was an assessment made after the person's death, as the Income Tax Act does not provide for such assessments. The High Court determined that the amounts received by the heirs and legal representatives were not liable to income tax in the hands of the heirs and legal representatives, as they could not be deemed to have been received by the deceased and were not income received in the previous year. The appeals were dismissed, and costs were awarded against the Commissioner of Income tax.
