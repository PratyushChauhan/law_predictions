The current legal case involves a petition filed by the father of an assessee challenging his son's arrest and detention for non-payment of income tax in Bombay. The case raises questions about the constitutionality of two laws, the Indian Income Tax Act and the Bombay City Land Revenue Act, 1876, as they allegedly violate fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution, including the right to personal liberty and equality before the law. The case also touches upon the different procedures for recovery of dues in different states, as the assessee in Bombay is subjected to a longer period of detention than in other states. The Attorney General argues that the section allowing Collectors in different states to adopt the machinery for recovery of arrears of land revenue as if it were an arrear of income tax demand does not violate the equal protection clause of the Constitution, as the Collectors have to follow the machinery prescribed by the state laws for recovery of arrears of land revenue. The court ultimately decides that the disparity between the provisions for the arrest and detention of defaulters residing in the City of Bombay and outside of it is eliminated through an amendment to the law, but calls for uniformity of procedure and identity of consequences from non-payment for the enforcement of the levy of a central tax like the Income tax. The court expresses reluctance about the different consequences for non-payment of income tax in different states and calls for a rational classification based on geographical areas, the susceptibilities of people in those areas, and their reactions to the adoption of methods of recovery. The court acknowledges that the legislature may have had reasonable bases for the differentiation, but some explanation is required for the different periods of detention for Bengal and the Punjab, as well as the complete exemption of Taluqdars in U.P. The court ultimately upholds the law, but calls for a more rational classification based on geographical areas, the susceptibilities of people in those areas, and their reactions to the adoption of methods of recovery.
