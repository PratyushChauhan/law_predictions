The current document is an appeal by a husband's ex-wife for a monthly allowance for maintenance under section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The husband challenged the decision in lower courts, arguing that his ex-wife was no longer eligible for maintenance as a divorcee. However, the court found that the husband's contention was beyond dispute, as the current Code provides that every divorcee is entitled to maintenance allowance, regardless of whether they have remarried or not. The court also rejected the husband's arguments that the liability to pay maintenance had ceased due to the payment of mehar or that there must be proof of neglect to maintain to attract section 125. The court emphasized the social perspective granted by Article 15(3) of the Constitution, which requires compassionate expansion of the meaning of section 125 to help women in distress cast away by divorce. The court also clarified that no settlement of claims can operate to negate the statutory right of the divorcee under section 125, and that the legal sanctity of the payment is certified by the fulfilment of the social obligation, not by a ritual exercise rooted in custom. The court allowed the appeal and restored the order of the trial court.
