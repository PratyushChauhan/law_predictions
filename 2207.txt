The current document is related to a legal case involving Abhoy Pada Saha, a member of the Sunri caste who identified as a member of a Scheduled Caste in his parliamentary election nomination paper. Sudhir Kumar Mondal, a member of the Scheduled Castes, objected to this and the Election Tribunal rejected his contention. Sudhir then filed a petition challenging the election, but the High Court declared it invalid and set it aside on the ground that Abhoy Pada did not belong to a Scheduled Caste. Abhoy Pada appealed this decision, and Sudhir also appealed to be declared elected in his place. The court found that the expression "excluding Saha" in the President's Order, which specified Scheduled Castes, referred to a smaller caste group within the Sunri caste group, and that Abhoy Pada belonged to this group. The court rejected the interpretation of the High Court that the expression referred to those Sunris who bore the surname Saha, as this was not explicitly stated in the Order. The court also criticized the Election Tribunal for interpreting the Order in the light of the evidence in the case, as this could lead to uncertainty. Ultimately, the court upheld the decision of the High Court to declare Abhoy Pada's election invalid, but rejected Sudhir's prayer to be declared elected in his place.
