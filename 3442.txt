The current document is a court decision in two tax appeals in India. The appeals relate to whether sales of a specific type of carbon, called "Cinema Arc Carbons," were correctly subjected to sales tax in two assessment years. The carbons, used primarily for producing powerful light in cinemas, were classified as falling under a specific entry in the sales tax schedule, which covered cinematographic equipment and accessories required for use with it. The court upheld the classification, based on the carbons' common or ordinary use, despite their potential use in other contexts. The decision was made by the Andhra Pradesh High Court, and the appeals were dismissed by the Supreme Court with costs. Other cases cited in the document were dismissed as having no bearing on the specific entry in question. The court emphasized the importance of interpreting sales tax schedules based on the intentions of the framers, as indicated by the language used in the entries.
