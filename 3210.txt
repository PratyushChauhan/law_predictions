The current document is related to a case involving non-compliance with requirements under sections 220, 131, 133, and 134 of the Companies Act in India. The case involves a complaint against a company and its directors for failing to submit balance sheets and profit and loss accounts within the required timeframe. The Andhra Pradesh High Court held that if no general body meeting is held, there is no obligation to submit these documents. However, the court clarified that while a company or its directors cannot rely on their failure to call a general body meeting as a defense in a prosecution under sections 32 and 133 of the Companies Act, there is a clear distinction between these sections and section 134, which only requires submission of copies of balance sheets and profit and loss accounts after they have been laid before the company at a general meeting. The court has not yet reached a decision on the appeal. The document also explains the requirements for filing financial documents with the registrar in India under sections 131, 133, and 134, which include presenting the documents at a general meeting and filing three copies with the registrar within 21 days. The obligation to file these documents is dependent on the holding of a general meeting, unlike in a previous case where the obligation was independent. The document concludes with the dismissal of an appeal related to these sections. No other details are provided.
