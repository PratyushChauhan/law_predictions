The current document details legal cases related to disputes between the Orissa High Court and the government of Orissa regarding the transfer and posting of judicial officers. The High Court requested that officers not remain in administrative posts for more than three years due to the negative impact prolonged absence from judicial work could have on their judicial approach and lead to deterioration. The government initially agreed but later refused to honor transfer requests, leading to the High Court transferring several officers and implementing the transfers despite the government's objections. The government then challenged these transfers in court, leading to the current legal proceedings. The document also touches on the authority of the High Court to transfer officers, the role of the Governor in filling certain administrative positions within the service, and the distinction between district courts and courts subordinate to district courts. The High Court's order holding that certain officers had no authority to hold their posts was deemed unsustainable, but the validity of the orders of transfer for other officers is still being contested. The document concludes with a decision by the court to partially allow the appeals and set aside the High Court's order regarding the authority of certain officers to hold their posts, while upholding the High Court's mandamus in other respects. The parties are directed to bear their own costs in the appeals.
