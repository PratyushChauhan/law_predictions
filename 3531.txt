The current document being discussed is a deed of nomination or will, dated April 25, 1897, in which Krishnabuwa, a disciple of Tukaram Maharaj, nominated Balkrishna Gangadhar Dhamurkar as the Devadhikari (spiritual successor) to succeed him. The document does not indicate that the religious institution, Shri Vithal Sukhamai Sansthan at Amalner, is a private property. Instead, it mentions that the property has always been treated as trust property, and the disciples who succeeded one after the other were not owners but trustees of the property. The document also states that the nature of the property and the avowed object and purpose of the founder have been carried into effect by successive loyal and devoted disciples, and the document does not admit of any other interpretation consistent with the nature of the property and the avowed object and purpose of the founder. The document, read as a whole, does not warrant a conclusion that the Sansthan is a private property.
