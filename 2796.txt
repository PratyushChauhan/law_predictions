The current document is an appeal case in the Indian legal system. The appellant, who was elected as a trustee for the Kumaran Koil temple in Manjakollai village, brought a lawsuit against the Commissioner of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments, Madras, who had affirmed an earlier decision by the Deputy Commissioner that the trusteeship of the temple was not hereditary. The appellant argued that the succession to the office of trusteeship was regulated by usage, as the trustees were elected for a one-year term at a meeting of the Sengunatha Mudaliar Community. However, the Madras High Court ruled against the appellant, stating that the phrase "regulated by usage" in the relevant section of the Act only applies when the ordinary rules of succession under Hindu law are modified by usage, and succession must be determined in accordance with the modified rules. The appellate court upheld the decision of the Madras High Court, finding that the office of trustee was not hereditary within the meaning of the relevant section of the Act, as the election to the office was for a fixed term and not for life. The court also noted that the possibility of a retiring trustee being reelected did not constitute a hereditary succession. The appeal was dismissed with costs.
