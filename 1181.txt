The current document is an appeal by the appellants against the cancellation of their allotment of land under the Evacuee Property Act, 1949. Their father had also been granted allotment of land in a different village, which was rejected when he applied for consolidation. Later, the allotment in the village Karodian was cancelled, and the land was allotted to the appellants. The appellants moved the Deputy Custodian General for review of the cancellation, which was dismissed due to the Evacuee Property (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act, 1954. The appellants argued that the Deputy Custodian General's decision was incorrect as the 1954 Act did not explicitly state that the Custodian's powers to deal with allotment or cancellation of allotment of evacuee property were taken away by the 1954 Act. The court agreed with the appellants, stating that the 1954 Act conferred the power to cancel allotments only on a managing officer or managing corporation appointed or constituted under that Act, and not on the Custodian appointed under the 1950 Act. The court also noted that the appellants had lost possession of the land before the publication of the notification under the 1954 Act and were therefore not entitled to the protection of the section that allowed displaced persons to continue in possession of their allotted land during the acquisition process. The managing officers appointed under the Act could cancel an allotment "for any other sufficient reason to be recorded in writing" under rule 102 of the Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Rules, 1955, as the acquired properties had ceased to be evacuee properties. The court dismissed the appeal, but no order was made as to costs due to the delay on the part of the Custodian General in dealing with the revision application.
