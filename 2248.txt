The current document is an appeal by the appellants against the judgment of the Madras High Court regarding the liability of a purchaser of a business for arrears of sales tax due from the previous dealer. The appellants argued that the State Government's rule making power under sections 19(1) and (2) of the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939 (Madras Act No. IX of 1939), which created a legal fiction making the transferee of the business liable for the arrears of sales tax, was beyond the rule making power granted to the State Government. The High Court held that the rule was ultra vires, as the word "assessment" in section 19(2)(c) did not include the power of recovering tax assessed from someone other than the assessee. The appellants also argued that the registered instrument dated October 5, 1956, by which the business was transferred to the respondent, created a contractual obligation between the transferee and the State Government, but the court rejected this argument, stating that there was no liability created inter se between the State Government and the transferee. The court dismissed the appeal with costs.
