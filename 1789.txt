The current document is an appeal by the Sasamusa Sugar Works Ltd. Against a decision by the Patna High Court regarding a claim made by their employees under the Payment of Wages Act. The employees argued that the refusal of the company to pay them wages at the rate awarded by an Industrial Tribunal was an illegal deduction, and the company contested this claim on the grounds that the wages prescribed by the award did not fall within the definition of wages under section 2(vi) of the Act before it was amended. The Patna High Court affirmed the employees' claim, and the company appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision, stating that the wages prescribed by the award were included in the definition of wages under section 2(vi) before the amendment, as they constituted a new contract between the parties in place of the old contractual wage structure. The appeal was dismissed, and the matter will be referred back to the payment of wages authority for further action.
